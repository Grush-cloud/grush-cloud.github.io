This is an overview of my homelab.

This is my first homelab that i've been working on for 3 months now. 

## Hardware Specifications
- Dell Optiplex 3070
- 32GB RAM
- Intel Core i5-9500
- Intel 82576 2-Port 1Gb NIC 
- TP-Link TL-SG108E

## Details
The Dell Optiplex 3070 is set up as a Proxmox server. The dual NIC is passed through to an OPNsense VM, which serves as the firewall for my entire network.  
I have configured my various containers and VMs across different VLANs, using the TP-Link smart switch for segmentation.


## Network Segmentation
- WAN
- LAN (Management)
- VLAN 10 (Trusted)
- VLAN 20 (Wan-Exposed Services)
- VLAN 30 (Media)

### WAN 
One of the interfaces on the dual NIC is passed through to the OPNsense VM and connected to my home router. I’m not using bridge mode because I want my home network to remain independent of my homelab.  

### LAN (Management Interface)

| VLAN-ID | Service/Device |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Default | Opnsense gui |
| Default | Tp-link Switch gui |
| Default | Proxmox gui |
| Default | Laptop |

The second interface on the dual NIC is passed through to OPNsense and serves as the management interface. This interface provides access to the OPNsense GUI, Proxmox GUI, and TP-Link switch GUI. My laptop connects to the LAN ports on the switch to access these management interfaces.

###  VLAN 10 (Trusted)

| VLAN-ID | Service/Device |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 10 | Adguard |
| 10 | Tailscale Subnet Router |

Traffic in this VLAN is considered "trusted" and is allowed to communicate with other VLANs.  
This VLAN hosts AdGuard, which serves as the DNS server for all my services and devices. For remote access, I have a Tailscale subnet router set up, enabling me to connect to my homelab from anywhere.

### VLAN 20 (Wan-Exposed Services)

| VLAN-ID | Service/Device |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 20 | Jellyfin |
| 20 | Jellyseer |
| 20 | Nginx proxy manager |
| 20 | Qbittorrent |

This VLAN is for "WAN-exposed services," meaning inbound connections from the WAN are allowed here.  
Since my home network and homelab are separate, I need to allow traffic from my home network (WAN) into OPNsense for services like Jellyfin and Jellyseer. Additionally, qBittorrent requires port forwarding to achieve optimal torrent speeds.


### VLAN 30 (MEDIA)

| VLAN-ID | Service/Device |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 30 | Prowlarr |
| 30 | Bazarr |
| 30 | Flaresolverr |
| 30 | Sonarr |
| 30 | Radarr |
| 30 | Bazarr |
| 30 | Sonarr-anime |
| 30 | Radarr-anime |
| 30 | Bazarr-anime |

This VLAN hosts my *Arr stack, which automates media management for Jellyfin.  
- **Sonarr**: For TV series (includes a separate instance for anime).  
- **Radarr**: For movies (includes a separate instance for anime).  
- **Bazarr**: For subtitles (includes a separate instance for the anime content).  
- **FlareSolverr**: Handles Cloudflare challenges for automation.  

These tools streamline media organization, making Jellyfin seamless and easy to use.

### VLAN 40 (Untrusted)
Currently, this VLAN does not host any services or devices. The plan is to use it for VMs dedicated to experiments, such as malware testing or other isolated activities.
This VLAN will be fully segregated from the rest of the network to ensure maximum security and prevent any potential risks from affecting trusted systems.

That’s a brief overview of my homelab. Thanks for reading!
